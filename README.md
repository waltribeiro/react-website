# Walt Ribeiro's Responsive Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, I can create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. 


## Technologies

I used the Bootstrap CSS Framework along with semantic HTML.

* The 3 pages I created are `index.html`, `portfolio.html`, and `contact.html`.

* The sticky navbar and sticky footer shows my ability to created responsive design no matter the size of the page.
